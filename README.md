## Description

The **World Happiness Report** dataset ranks countries based on their happiness levels, determined by factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and perceptions of corruption. This project aims to analyze these relationships using various data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms.

### Features:
- **Happiness Score**: The dependent variable (target), representing the happiness level of each country.
- **GDP per capita**: Economic output per person.
- **Social Support**: The perceived level of social support from friends and family.
- **Life Expectancy**: The average life expectancy of the population.
- **Freedom**: The perceived freedom to make life choices.
- **Generosity**: The level of charitable giving.
- **Corruption**: Perception of corruption in the government.
- **Dystopia Residual**: A constant used for normalizing scores.
